# Belly Button Diversity Dashboard

The following two files are for the challenge: [chart.js](https://github.com/jzaragoza21/Plotly_Deployment/blob/main/Challenge/charts.js) | [index.html](https://github.com/jzaragoza21/Plotly_Deployment/blob/main/Challenge/index.html)

## Overview

This challenge's objective was to finalize the incomplete dashboard to make it more interactive and visually appealing. To that end, we integrated the dataset/study of microbes that colonize the human navel provided in the JSON file so that visitors of the webpage could explore and display bar, bubble and gauge charts for each subject in the belly button study. In doing so, we were able to execute this challenge by applying HTML, Javascript and Plotly.
